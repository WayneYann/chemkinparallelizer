If parameter estimation/optimization is to be performed, the chemistry input file (usually chem.inp) needs to be 'cleaned' by ChemClean (download from: http://c3.nuigalway.ie/software.html). Moreover, the Species thermodynamics need to be in the same file as the reaction mechanism.

When in parity plot mode (0), experimental data can be provide in mass fractions (instead of the standard molar flow rates). This facilitates the comparison of model predictions with experimental data.

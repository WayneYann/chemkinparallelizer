added by Nick Vandewiele (31/03/2010):
If parameter estimation/optimization is to be performed, the chemistry input file (usually chem.inp) needs to be 'cleaned' by ChemClean (download from: http://c3.nuigalway.ie/software.html). Moreover, the Species thermodynamics need to be in the same file as the reaction mechanism.

added by Nick Vandewiele (08/04/2010): feature available in v7 of NBMT
When in parity plot mode (0), experimental data can be provide in mass fractions (instead of the standard molar flow rates). This facilitates the comparison of model predictions with experimental data.

added by Nick Vandewiele (09/04/2010):required files for a correct functioning of NBMT
-chemkindata.dtd (required file by Chemkin for postprocessing conversion of xml file)
-INPUT.txt (main input file with pointers to working directory, etc)
-chemkin chemistry input file (e.g. chem.inp): TD data of species must be included in a proper way
-reactor_input.csv: excel generated summary of reactor input files
-exp_data.csv: experimental data of output variables (containing mass fractions in case parity plots are generated)
-reactor_input_template.inp: template file of a reactor setup configuration that will be used to generated the reactor input files from the excel reactor_input.csv file

added by Nick Vandewiele (09/04/2010): NBMT is suitable for Chemkin 4.1, not for Chemkin 4.5

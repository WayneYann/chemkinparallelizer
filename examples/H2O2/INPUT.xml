		The tag "experimental_databases" contains information on the results a simulation or experiment can produce: 
		Currently, three types of experimental databases are possible:
			-Product Yields 
			-Ignition Delays
			-Flame Speeds
			
		The type of experimental database is passed as attribute to the experimental_database tag
		The filename of an experimental database is passed as a value of the experimental_database tag

		The tag "reactor_setups" contains information on the simulation settings required to 
		run simulations in chemkin:
		
		The type attribute specifies whether each simulation will be generated automatically (AUTO)
		or manually created (MANUAL)
		
		The filename of an reactor_setup is passed as a value of the reactor_setup tag
		
		The reactor model is specified in the "model" attribute.
		Currently, these are the supported models:
			-PFR (plug flow reactor)
			-CSTR
